2. **SummaTube automatically appears** in the right sidebar showing the transcript
3. **Click timestamps** to jump to specific parts of the video

## How It Works

### Transcript Extraction
The extension automatically:
- Detects when you're watching a YouTube video
- Extracts available transcripts using YouTube's native interface
- Organizes content into 30-second chunks for easy navigation

### AI Summarization
- Click "✨ Generate AI Summary" to get AI-powered video summaries
- Summaries are cached per video for faster subsequent loads
- Powered by advanced language models for accurate, concise summaries

### User Interface
- **Minimizable Panel**: Collapse when not needed, expand when you want to read
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to YouTube's changing layout
- **Smooth Animations**: Modern transitions and hover effects
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when transcripts aren't available

## Permissions

SummaTube requires the following permissions:

- **`activeTab`**: Interact with YouTube pages to extract transcripts
- **`storage`**: Store your OpenAI API key and cache summaries locally
- **`host_permissions`**: Connect to `https://api.openai.com/` for AI summarization

## Privacy & Security

- **API Key Storage**: Your OpenAI API key is stored locally in your browser's storage
- **Direct API Calls**: Summaries are generated by calling OpenAI directly from your browser
- **No External Servers**: We don't store or process your API key or transcripts
- **Open Source**: Review the code to verify privacy practices

## Privacy & Security

- **No Data Collection**: Transcripts are processed locally when possible
- **Secure API Calls**: All external communication uses HTTPS
- **Privacy Policy**: Available at [summa.tube/policies/privacy](https://summa.tube/policies/privacy)
- **Content Security Policy**: Implemented to prevent cross-site scripting attacks

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Appearing
- **Refresh the page**: Sometimes YouTube's dynamic loading requires a refresh
- **Check video compatibility**: Make sure the video has captions/transcripts available
- **Verify installation**: Ensure the extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`

### Transcript Not Loading
- **Wait a moment**: Transcript extraction takes 1-2 seconds
- **Check video language**: Currently supports videos with available captions
- **Try refreshing**: YouTube's interface may have changed

### AI Summary Issues
- **Check internet connection**: Summaries require API access
- **Verify API key**: Ensure your OpenAI API key is set and valid
- **Check OpenAI account**: Make sure you have credits in your OpenAI account
- **Wait for processing**: AI summarization takes a few seconds
- **Retry if failed**: Network issues or API limits can cause temporary failures

### API Key Issues
- **Key not saved**: Try refreshing the page after setting your API key
- **Invalid key**: Verify your API key from OpenAI Platform
- **Rate limits**: OpenAI has usage limits depending on your plan
- **Security**: Your API key is stored locally and only used for OpenAI requests

### Performance Issues
- **Close other tabs**: Multiple YouTube tabs may impact performance
- **Clear browser cache**: Old cached data can cause issues
- **Restart browser**: Sometimes a fresh start resolves problems

## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome**: 88+ (Manifest V3 support required)
